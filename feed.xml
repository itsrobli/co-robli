    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since I found out about Japanese toothpicks - I have been watching out for other interesting Japanese designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese design, particularly of every day objects, is something I find pleasing. Good design promotes efficiency as a social norm. In a society like Japan where people live in dense areas, and time is so scarce, these cultural norms are extremely important for cities to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-care-is-in-the-details"&gt;The care is in the details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with the humble toothpick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese toothpick is designed so that the end of it can be easily snapped off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This indicates this commodity object is now someone’s property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most interestingly, the newly snapped-off end can now be used to lift the toothpick off the table so it can be re-used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_01.jpg" alt="tootchpicks yo!" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of thinking about eating utensils extends to soup spoons as well. The spoon that comes with ramen has a little hook at the end that stops it from falling back into the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_02.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of minor conveniences - all adding up to reduce overall friction. Recycling bins next to vending machines. Machines to check you in and out of hotels. Parcel delivery to the airport rather than your hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_03.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of these little things all indicate a culture where people think things through. Everything is designed with intent right down to the minor details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And along with conveniences, there is real efficiency gains that are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a queue area for a bank teller which has an overflow area across the path way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_04.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often do you have to walk around a queue of people, just standing around, in Sydney?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-cohesive-society---precedure-and-order"&gt;A cohesive society - precedure and order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a diagram at a metro train platform that tells you which carriage you should use to be closest to the exit at every station along that train line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_05.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then clearly marked is where you should line up so you are simultaneously close to your train carriage door but also not in the way of people exiting the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_06.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a small aside, if you catch a bullet train, you will see the train guards performing this ritual. I researched that they do this because pointing at the items you are checking reduces human error. This dance looks ridiculous to an outsider, but it demonstrates the commitment to following well thought-out procedures with precision and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_07.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also important conveniences for people who use wheelchairs and need the lower buttons (at every lift I used in Japan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_12.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dedication to order and procedure extends to eating as well. Everything has its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_08.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_17.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-tidbits"&gt;Other tidbits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always somewhere to put your bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In restaurants…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_09.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and toilets. And yes, they’re extremely clean toilets! - I saw people using the shelves and hooks all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_10.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heated mirrors so you don’t have to wipe it off after a shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_11.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the signs were rather amusing (and often sexist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_13.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are just so detailed even foreigners can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_14.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other times, they’re just whimsical…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_15.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…but often, functional. Why put a solar powered light here, because you need it…and you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_16.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bad-design---why-sydney-trains-run-late-when-it-rains-when-the-sun-is-shining-when-there-is-a-breeze-when-somebody-coughs"&gt;Bad design - why Sydney trains run late when it rains, when the sun is shining, when there is a breeze, when somebody coughs…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need an example of bad design, just get on board a Sydney Cityrail Train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will experience the common phenomenon of seeing the person boarding in front of you stepping onto the train and then suddenly freezing in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a good 5 seconds, they move into the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as you recover from almost walking into them (and stopping the queue of people behind you), you step onto the train, you look up, and you suddenly freeze too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ritual repeats itself as each person boards the train. The freezing is more common amongst the non-frequent commuters and tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete list of possible places to sit/stand after entering a Sydney Cityrail Train:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Left&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Left crevice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forward left crevice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forward right crevice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right downstairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right upstairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right in between up and down stairs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right crevice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2016/01/jap_des_18_cityrail.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shit would not be tolerated in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FF-tKLISfPE?t=1m46s"&gt;once said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the right approach to doing most things. Start  by thinking about the outcome you want, then figure out the how. The common mistake is to instead look at the skills and resources available, then figure out what can be created given those constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 3 goals for this new website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want the site to be fast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want it to be cheap to run.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want all my &lt;a href="/about/"&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt; to live in a central hub I control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="years-on-the-mac"&gt;10 years on the Mac&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Macintosh is an example of a product where the people who made it first thought about the outcome, the user experience, then figured out the technology (like &lt;a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt"&gt;rounded rects&lt;/a&gt;) that were required to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of building this website reminded me of all the reasons why I love the Mac. All the tools I need are easily available - either pre-installed, or a simple &lt;code&gt;brew install $WHATEVER&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="http://brew.sh"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, OS X runs on top of Unix. The open web is usually some flavour of Unix&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Developing for the web on the Mac is a joy because most concepts and commands are the same (e.g. file systems, permissions, tools like &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;). Everything feels native and familiar. When I open up the Mac terminal app and SSH into my web server it’s the same environment I’m familiar with on my Mac. &lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, ￼&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)"&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt;￼…it’s just all there and it’s all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past 10 years on the Mac have been the most creative of my life simply because there is so much support out there for making things on the Mac. Beyond the tutorials, the available apps are best of breed and usually open-source. I learned photography, video editing and programming all on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the Mac and OS X continue to evolve and stay true to themselves&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="its-just-some-implementation-detail-dont-worry-about-it"&gt;It’s just some implementation detail, don’t worry about it…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execution &lt;a href="http://robli.co/2014/10/12/Executing-on-the-vision/"&gt;is everything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is far from great. But I believe a lot of the fundamental architecture and design decisions are &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="solving-for-outcome-1---speed"&gt;Solving for outcome 1 - speed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the web in 2015 is it’s slow and bloated. Many popular sites are full of ads and tracking that make pages load slowly, suck your phone battery dry and blast noise from autoplaying videos you don’t want to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see below from a simple test I did on the &lt;a href="http://smh.com.au"&gt;SMH&lt;/a&gt; homepage I found 22 trackers active - a lot of them are advertising related. These trackers each fire off their own scripts and make additional network requests - often running long after the main webpage has loaded - chewing up battery life unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://robli.co/images/2015/08/smh-trackers.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2015/08/smh-trackers.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did two things to tackle this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="scripts"&gt;Scripts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this site runs as little JavaScript as possible. This is an easy decision for me because I don’t need to make money off this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do run some JavaScript where it’s needed. However, I do not put any scripts in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the HTML because I don’t want anything taking priority over the rendering of the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to use footnotes in my blogs to add little bits of info&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but I don’t like the traditional method of linking to footnotes at the bottom of an article. It makes for a bad reading experience to have to jump up and down within an article. I use &lt;a href="http://www.bigfootjs.com"&gt;bigfoot&lt;/a&gt; to show the footnotes in a pop-up. The traditional footnotes are still at the bottom. As with any JavaScript library, &lt;a href="https://jquery.com"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; is also required. What can you do&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I also run &lt;a href="http://www.google.com.au/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to track what’s happening on this site. You can read about some of the privacy implications &lt;a href="/privacy/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="static-site"&gt;Static site&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of blogs use a CMS like &lt;a href="https://wordpress.org"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. I like Wordpress. My &lt;a href="http://robertwli.com"&gt;previous effort&lt;/a&gt; ran on Wordpress and I have been using it for almost 10 years. The problem with Wordpress is that I believe a CMS is overkill for a blog. There is no need for a server to put together a blog post for the user every time a page is requested. The page is going to be the same for every visitor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building once and serving the same page to everyone is a better approach for a site like mine. This way, my server&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is only sending raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript to each request which is retrieved directly from the server’s file system. This minimises work done by the server which speeds up the overall request/response cycle. As a side benefit, this also bypasses many security issues that can arise from having a database backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; I don’t want to craft every single page like an animal - programming can help with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built this site using &lt;a href="https://middlemanapp.com"&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt; which is a static site generator. It programatically pieces together each page and every possible permutation of a page. That way, I can build once and then deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middleman is quite capable so far, easy to use&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and very customisable. It has dedicated blogging tools and plenty of modules to add-on functionality later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tidbits about the design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I designed the site from the ground up and wrote a lot of custom CSS to get it looking how I wanted. The foundation is &lt;a href="http://getbootstrap.com"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; so I didn’t have to worry too much about mobile vs desktop rendering and sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why orange? I wanted the background to be white because I wanted images to blend easily into the page. I didn’t want the usual boring blue highlight colours so I opted for orange which goes well with white, I think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a great side benefit of the static site approach, it means there is significantly less demand on the server’s resources and hence only minimum computing power is required bringing down costs and brings me to the next outcome required…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="solving-for-outcome-2---server-running-costs"&gt;Solving for outcome 2 - server running costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My choice in using a static site also results in minimum server requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using a &lt;a href="http://digitalocean.com/"&gt;VPS&lt;/a&gt; that costs $5/month with 512MB of memory and uses SSDs for storage. SSDs are fairly cheap now in a VPS environment, and given the limited memory, the storage performance must be top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VPS also hosts all my other content from the &lt;a href="http://robertwli.com/"&gt;robertwli.com&lt;/a&gt; and robli.org domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="solving-for-outcome-3---central-hub"&gt;Solving for outcome 3 - central hub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the web is moving to a place where everyone’s content is stored and owned by private companies like Facebook, Google and Apple. This in itself is not a bad thing. They provide great services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a believer in the power of the open web. A web where you control, store and serve your own content over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="my-projects"&gt;My projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="/about/"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page lists all the stuff I have worked on past and present. Hopefully, I will keep adding to this page as I tackle new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://robli.co/images/2015/08/roblico-about-section.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://robli.co/images/2015/08/roblico-about-section.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="my-photos"&gt;My photos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also finally have a &lt;a href="/photos/"&gt;place for my photos&lt;/a&gt; that I’m fairly happy with. Ironically, I started to learn programming because I was not happy with any of the templates the typical photo portfolio websites offered. After getting side-tracked with programming for 2 years, I circled back to the original task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be adding progressively to this as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="img-hero" src="http://robli.co/images/2015/08/roblico-photos-section-combined.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;usually linux&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Afterall, it’s the existence of the Mac that allows the next generaiton of computing devices like iOS devices to have the freedom to stay simple and be true to themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;like this&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On the bright side, chances are you already have 4 different versions of jQuery cached on your computer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why? I don’t know, I guess I like to know what’s going on with the site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;just a bare bones Linux box somewhere in &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com"&gt;Digital Ocean’s&lt;/a&gt; farm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:7"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;if you’re experienced with the Ruby/Rails conventions&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="lets-start-with-an-observation"&gt;Let's start with an observation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The owner of 
&lt;a href="http://www.ccard3.com"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; programs and designs apps and websites. He also designs icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is 14 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of "kids" doing this kind of thing nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the population of people paid to do these things, I would bet less than 10% of the working population over the age of 40 would have any idea how to do these things to even a basic level of skill. I would also bet that % figure rises fast as the age group becomes younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have drawn a fun&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; illustration of this concept below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2014/12/20141231_jobs_to_be_done_graph_perc_of_ppl.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 14 year old's skills have an important place in future economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these skills, and others we currently regard as specialist skills, will become trivial skills in the future. The only unknown is when.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about the skills you have that you use at work every day. Which of these are skills that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No employer would pay extra for (i.e. are expected); and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are useful; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once were the domain of specifically paid workers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can think of photocopying, typing, managing schedules, managing digital content, taking the elevator to the correct floor, making coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all skills now considered so trivial that everyone is expected to do as part of their daily routine&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-little-bit-of-background"&gt;A little bit of background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we take a salary or run a business, we are "hired" for a "job" to be done. A "job to be done" is a 
&lt;a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/"&gt;useful framework&lt;/a&gt; to help understand what motivates and drives the business transactions underpinning the economy. Customers buy things, and businesses hire people because they find themselves with a problem they need solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees acquire skills and business operators apply these skills to solve the customers' "problems". These skills may be advanced degrees or acquired through work experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems get solved in new ways all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New products enter markets because they solve problems in a better way (e.g. cheaper, easier or quicker)&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence (or as a cause depending on the circumstances), businesses devise new or better ways to do things - requiring less employees or those with a different mixture of skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-little-bit-of-illustrating"&gt;A little bit of illustrating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I've drawn conceptually how salaried jobs/roles evolve over time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2014/12/20141231_jobs_to_be_done_over_time.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, accounting and financial forecasting used to take 
ages. It used to takes ages and required an army of people. Educated people. Expensive people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses used to hire MBAs to model fancy financial concepts - and these MBAs could do it, they just needed an army of people recalculating every number whenever an input changed (which was often)&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Businesses used to also hire armies of accountants, pencilling in entries into giant ledgers (made of paper&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then these machines started popping up - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II"&gt;Apple II's&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc"&gt;VisiCalc&lt;/a&gt; to be exact. Spreadsheets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreadsheets made these tasks orders of magnitude quicker and as a result requiring less and differently skilled workers. Then, as computers became easier to use, spreadsheets quickly went from a specialist skill, to basic junior level work, to an expected skill. The operator transformed from a skilled analyst, to a macro button pusher and then into an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning"&gt;ERP system&lt;/a&gt; generated report. The ERP systems are now all cloud-based&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and can be hosted and used anywhere by anyone, or, one day, by no-one at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we've seen over the last 30 years is that most of this work has been automated or offshored or done by one person when there used to be three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is still there. The job is still being done. The solution is just different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="finally-to-my-point"&gt;Finally to my point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are salaried jobs out there that one day everyone will be expected to do. There are even more jobs out there that will decrease in value and will be outsourced to the cheapest bidder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the exact same jobs we currently think need "professional" training and expertise. The only thing we don't know is which jobs and when. Some will make this transition over the next 5 years, others, 25 or 50 years. Given we are all living longer lives, there is a high chance we will experience these transitions. Some of us already are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen this happen to the automobile industry and more recently to the publishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition is slow and the signs are not obvious. It's easy to attribute your salary freeze or company's decline in sales to the economy. Yet, at the same time, a Google engineer's starting salary is $100,000, the Dow Jones closed at a record high of \~18,000, and the revenue growth of Google, Amazon and Apple is phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These businesses are not in new markets. Advertising, retail and consumer goods have been around for a very long time. These business are simply approaching the "job to be done" in a new way. New ways that require new skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples are also not unique. Just look at the 
&lt;a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/funding-rounds"&gt;steady stream&lt;/a&gt; of businesses starting up. Most are just solving old problems in new ways; and the few brilliant ones are solving new problems, creating new markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having my professional skills become worthless one day is the one thing that scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to stop that from happening is to have substantially more useful skills than a 14 year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="optimism"&gt;Optimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer quips 
&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/7lhlKF6MECs?t=21m33s"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Salespeople at Microsoft are naturally optimistic, probably everywhere. Just tell us where to go and we're gonna run! And I know we're gonna succeed! Because people want to believe. Engineers, you say, here's where we're going to go, and the first thing they say is, oh, come on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That's not right. That's not the right way to go. But I have found - and this might belie my fundamental optimism - that the engineer's optimist is sometimes a little different than the salesman. &lt;strong&gt;While the salesman just says, where to go, charge, the engineer likes to say, the world is all screwed up, but I can fix it. That's an engineer's optimism to me. Everything's– but I can fix it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2014/12/20141231_jobs_to_be_done_over_time_future.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are currently two tech trends of note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPad sales growth was astronomical for the first few years but over &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/tim-cook-on-ipad-sales/"&gt;the last few quarters growth has slowed noticeably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are currently two tech trends of note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iPad sales growth was astronomical for the first few years but over &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/tim-cook-on-ipad-sales/"&gt;the last few quarters growth has slowed noticeably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microsoft is putting a lot of effort into their Surface line being &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/YfpULoEZIHk"&gt;currently marketed as the perfect tablet-laptop hybrid&lt;/a&gt; and it’s finally starting to &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/8642/microsoft-q1-fy-2015-financial-results-record-revenue-on-strong-consumer-sales"&gt;get some interest and make some money&lt;/a&gt; for them (although some &lt;a href="http://www.citeworld.com/article/2461707/tablets/microsoft-has-lost-about-17-billion-on-surface-so-far.html"&gt;have pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that they’re still $1.7bn in the red overall on that product line).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think iPad sales stagnation is a direct consequence of its functionality stagnation. The iPad fills niches very well (like for people who don’t like/need/never experienced a desktop operating systems), however, what you can do on a tablet that you can't on a smartphone has stagnated and many people are still not convinced they need it when they already have a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there appears to be interest in some sort of device that is more powerful than a tablet but just as easy to use. Something that is as easy to use as a touch based operating system whilst still powerful like a “traditional” keyboard + mouse/trackpad operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think such a device needs a whole new user interaction model&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current two interaction models are quite distinct and I don't believe the solution is simply taking a little from column A and a little from column B. I don't think anyone has figured it out yet (or necessarily ever will).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-surface-hybrid-device-but-mostly-just-crap"&gt;The Surface: hybrid device but mostly just crap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2014/10/Surface-Press-02-623-80.jpg" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the original Surface was released along with Windows 8, my opinion was that it was poorly executed because it didn't solve the hard problem of the user interaction model&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; of both worlds, the Surface ended up being the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any aspect of it that was better than a tablet was completely outweighed by it being too heavy and thick.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You had to deal with a soft-touch keyboard and kick stand. Both were things trying to solve problems that already had solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The touchscreen-keyboard hybrid interaction model was implemented very badly. A sign of bad design is that there are choices for the user when instead the designer should have just figured out the best solution. Windows 8 was the epitome of this with a desktop version of an app and a touch version. It was like someone tried to present the best bits of both then then just gave up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="convergence-is-a-user-interaction-model-problem"&gt;Convergence is a user interaction model problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem with a hybrid device is that the user interaction model has not been figured out yet. Microsoft is dabbling in the middle, at the crossroads, and failing. Apple and Google are focusing on their touch and desktop OSs and working out how they can &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite#Continuity"&gt;better integrate&lt;/a&gt; (not converge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tablet is good not just because it’s small and light but because the touch interface is intuitive. A laptop (or desktop PC) is not just a good device because it’s powerful&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but because the keyboard and mouse/trackpad are a dynamic combination offering precision and speed (hotkeys/shortcuts) that can’t be replicated on the touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware problem of the first Surface/Windows 8 products were inevitably going to be solved; the user interaction model problem was not. Having something small, light and thin was never the problem stopping laptop and tablet convergence. It’s not a hardware technology problem. It’s not difficult to put a touchscreen in a laptop or make a touchscreen stand in front of you. The original Surface &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+Teardown/12842#s44058"&gt;had fans&lt;/a&gt; and was bulky and as generations have progressed it has become more refined&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend will continue when Intel releases in mass quantities its delayed Broadwell processors, the Surface (and all laptops really) will take on slimmer form factors and &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/the-pc-at-ifa-part-2-mini-desktops-and-thin-fanless-broadwell-tablets/"&gt;lose their fans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty as Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNVsn1P4GlM"&gt;correctly said&lt;/a&gt; is that touch screens "don't want to be vertical…they are ergonomically terrible".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-28-at-11.34.50-pm.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is each existing user interaction model doesn't work well with the other form factor. More specifically, touch does not scale up well into complex environments; and keyboard + mouse does not scale down well into intuitive environments (as we have seen over the last 30 years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is tiring swiping at a laptop screen that is sitting vertical in front of you when you have a keyboard on your lap.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is frustrating using a tablet and having to copy/paste repeatedly without a keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is almost impossible to do fine adjustments on screen without a mouse&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it can be very confusing dealing with a desktop operating system - a touch/mobile operating system can be much more intuitive to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each user interaction model needs to be true to themselves because they don't scale well beyond themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-likely-future-is-not-convergence-but-a-evolved-tablet"&gt;The likely future is not convergence but a evolved tablet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the tablet is going to get better at doing the 95% of things that 95% of people need to do on a computer before someone is going to figure out the user interaction model of a truly great tablet-laptop hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a good enough replacement for 95% of people and they won’t need a desktop operating system anymore. We are likely to see these evolutions over the next couple of years. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easier to understand file system abstractions (the iCloud model of the file lives with app was an attempt but it fails for many reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More elegant inter-app communications that doesn't just give the user a big list to pick which app the user wants next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More intuitive interfaces for multi-tasking. Side-by-side windows may be one obvious answer but not a very good one (especially looking from the point of view of the proverbial grandparent). It introduces a whole new class of problems like: how does an app decide how big it needs its window to be? how does the user override this? will the controls for closing/resizing "windows" be on-screen and if not how will they be accessed?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these things will evolve and get to a point where most people will see their tablet as beyond something they just watch videos or read the web on. It will become a truly productive and creative machine. This will be all achieved by having better system software and by having better apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tablet can't be stuck at the crossroad like the Surface, it needs to decide what it wants to be. Otherwise, it will cease to exist. The smartphone will eat its bottom end and the laptop will eat the top end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we're speaking in terms of tablets being &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-PC_era"&gt;post-PC product&lt;/a&gt;, then I think its quite clear the hybrid products currently on the market are not post-PC products. They are really just very advanced laptops with some touch goodies sprinkled on top. This is exactly what makes them crap. The laptop will instead succeed by being true to itself and Google and Apple are taking this direction in their own interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is a phrase or not but I’m runing with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is as true for the Surface as it is for third party OEM products from Toshiba, Asus, Lenovo, etc&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Command line, keyboard shortcuts, multi-tasking, etc&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Once you put fans inside anything it ceases to be a tablet. It's as simple as that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I watched someone do this on the train to work and I got tired just from watching. Type type type -&amp;gt; swipe, tap -&amp;gt; type type -&amp;gt; swipe….&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Althought software has handled this problem very well by presenting big dials for fine tuning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple emphasised this message recently during 
&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/38IqQpwPe7s?t=50m"&gt;their Apple Pay announcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are not in the business of collecting your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They emphasised that their business model does not rely on collecting user data. This was clearly a dig at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Apple is hoping to run every purchase you make through their Apple Pay payment system, they are 
not going to collect that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this age of ad-supported business models, it's surprising to hear a technology business stating they 
don't want your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I heard that part, I could picture execs at Amazon and Google crying inside at the lost opportunity of getting some sweet sweet data. Much in the same way I can picture Apple and Microsoft execs cyring inside when Google gives away Android, Chrome OS, GMail, Google Docs, etc, etc away for "free".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple pushed out this messsage &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/686851"&gt;over and over again&lt;/a&gt;. All the Apple PR culminated with &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy"&gt;this open letter&lt;/a&gt; and their new 
&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. The open letter is very reminiscent of Steve Jobs' Thoughts on &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070208225127/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic"&gt;Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; open letters. This means it's a statement of intention. It's an important message about the future, strategtic direction of Apple's business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think this is about Apple being concerned about your privacy (maybe they are, maybe they're not). This is about Apple doubling down on its business model of selling you shiny devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is interesting because it's Apple making a bet 
against big data. A bet that ad-supported, free products and services are ultimately going to be rejected by customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, people have questioned if Apple's traditional business model (of selling you stuff at a nice mark-up) could survive in the new world of Google, Facebook and Amazon with their heavily subsidised and free products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose this is Apple responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="big-data-advertising-and-ad-supported-productsservices"&gt;Big data, advertising and ad-supported products/services.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses like Google and Facebook have huge investments in big data. For example, Facebook's data storage 6 months ago totalled 300 petabytes (15 zeroes) and ingesting data at a rate of 600 terabytes per day&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. At this scale, they are literally pushing the boundaries of computer science. You can bet that's expensive both in terms of their people's skill in writing software and the hardware/data centres they have to buy/build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies believe that contained within these gigantic data sets, there is special (magical) information that can only be learned by collecting data sets of that size. This is at the heart of their business model of selling targeted ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This busines model was long ago coined by the nerds of the internetz as "you are the product". Interestingly, Tim Cook has used this well known phrase in &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/"&gt;his letter&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, &lt;strong&gt;you’re not the customer. You’re the product&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true. When you use Google, you are not the customer. Google Search is not the product. A customer is the person paying the business to produce a product or service. You (your data) is sold to advertisers who are the ones that pay Google (and Facebook and Twitter and etc etc). By definition you are the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big data is an advertiser's wet dream. By collecting huge data sets on you through social media and Google searches, it is possible to not only know what demographic you are part of, but what you are thinking, feeling and even where you will be at a future date with fairly high degrees of accuracy. Research like 
&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is commonplace. Researchers recently pushed the boundaries further by &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full"&gt;finding out&lt;/a&gt; if your emotional state (mood) can spread to your friends via Facebook posts. This can lead to not only influencing you (just like they do with traditional forms of advertising) but influencing you 
and your friends…at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and collecting big data is so important to these businesses, that they are even willing to sacrifice user experience for the sake of it (as Facebook did by allowing experiements on almost 700,000 of their users without their knowledge&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="apples-bet-against-big-data"&gt;Apple's bet against big data.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;img src="/images/2014/09/apple-pay.jpg" /&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt; Banksy could not have done this better. Image source: TechCrunch (http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/09/announces-mobile-payments-solution-called-apple-pay/) &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big data is not just useful for the typical free-to-use-but-pay-with-your-data service/product. It's useful, to various degrees, to a range of businesses. It can tell the coffee shop that on Fridays people go to work later and hence the rush hour crowd should be prepared for a little later. It can tell your supermarket to stock more chips and beer on a Friday night. It can tell Apple that 30% of iPhone buyers will also buy an Apple branded case if given the choice and hence they should make and sell them at a 38% profit margin&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Apple's recent move to consciously know 
less about you - to not collect data - is so interesting. They are saying that they don't believe big data's payoff (it's insights into you as a consumer and all the magical, mind-control future possibilities) is ever going to crystallise and even if it does, it's not going to be worth the investment&lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/"&gt;Tim Cook is very explicit about Apple's business model&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t “monetize” the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about this and I came up with 3 reasons for why Apple might be doing this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple has never really paid much attention to what users want. They like to tell you what you want and take away everything they don't think you need. This is at the core of Apple's product design philosophy&lt;sup id="fnref:8"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.Therefore, having insight into who you are and what you like is not really all that important to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This offers Apple a huge point of differentiation from Google (whom Tim Cook pointed to as their main competitor)&lt;sup id="fnref:9"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Under Google's current ad-supported business model, they simply can't take this approach or they will go broke.This makes it a risky move for Apple because it may turn out that people don't really care about their privacy when in return they get a great product or service for free or heavily subsidised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big data insights aren't all that accurate (and possibly never will be). When I watch YouTube I see a lot of ads for Toyota.Yet when I was buying my car:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I researched Ford car models using Google Search.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I emailed Ford dealers for quotes via GMail.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I stored brochures for Ford cars on Google Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes Toyota, your money was well spent on Google. They targeted your product perfectly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing with big data, and the entire digital media industry that surrounds it, is nobody knows if it works. There are lots of examples of it working. And there are examples like mine above that show that it doesn't work all that well (or maybe it does and my next car will be a Toyota). The beauty of it is, if it's not working, that's because they need more data; and if it works, that's because they told you it would work. The typical rainmaker argument - you can't lose until people stop believeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="understanding-business-models-is-key"&gt;Understanding business models is key.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From reading all this, you may think I have a bug up my arse about privacy and big data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see these topics from the point of view of scientific curiosity&lt;sup id="fnref:10"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this all very interesting when looking at it from the point of view of the business model that drives these decisions. When you cut through all the spin, you start to have a glimpse at what this is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/514895987312046080"&gt;Benedict Evans says it best here (@BenedictEvans) 25/09/2014 7:55 am&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apple does not collect data in much the same that Google does not charge. They're both giving someone else's business away for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tweet sums it all up nicely. Understanding the business model helps you understand why these businesses are doing what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It explains why Android phones and Chrome laptops are cheaper (no licencing fees for the OS in exchange for user data); why Facebook will pay $19 Bn for Whatsapp (more users == more data); and why Apple bought Beats and hired top people from Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry (they need people who know how to make and can influence you to buy shiny things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's still not clear to me at this stage if either business model is better than the other. They both work well. Both business models incentivise the business to make better products and make the user experience better. Google Search is a terrific product. So is a MacBook Pro. It's just very interesting that Apple, the biggest player in the tech industry, has just said no to one of these business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to write more posts like this sharing some of the things I've learned about the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice reminder of who this man was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am even more happy about &lt;a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2090829/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html"&gt;Apple's vision for the Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, happy birthday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShLWK9n2Sk"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Mac, today you are celebrating your 30th birthday. Here are some things we wanted you to know as you enter your fourth decade. Your early family really loved you. We had lots of fun being pirates and working very hard together, before you were born. You were a cute, chubby little baby who has grown up to be as slender as a No. 2 pencil with the power of an NFL middle linebacker. You were writing and drawing sketches at a very early age, who would have guessed that you'd now be making movies all by yourself and sharing it with people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Your list of accomplishments is truly astounding. We are very, very proud of all the tasks you have mastered. Many more than we could have ever imagined! Never forget that your parents wanted you to always be respectful of the individuality of your users. And we hope that you will continue to help them communicate their uniqueness to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can't let vanity and compliments about your beauty stop you from always remembering your core purpose: fostering innovation and creativity. Finally, don't forget to keep your sense of humor. True artist not only ship, but laugh! Don't forget about the little Mac Man who used to run across the desktop every once in a while. So, have an insanely great happy birthday. We all wish you continued success in your next 30 years, helping pilot the Mothership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours, members of the 1984 Macintosh Development Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
