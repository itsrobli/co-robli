        <p>I don't believe the theory that Google is an evil corporation sucking up your personal data to sell it to advertising businesses.</p>

<p>Google is made up of people.</p>

<p>I don't believe people are inherently evil - nor do I believe they are inherently good. People are, however, biased towards particular behaviour due to their life experiences.</p>

<p>I think life presents you with certain choices that include compromises and people (Google) make the best choice they can with what they know at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html">Google announced</a> on 13 January that it would acquire Nest for $3.2bn.</p>

<p>I think this is a significant indicator of Google's strategy.</p>

<p>I need to state two broad stroke premises:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Google is an advertising business which uses it's core competency of large scale machine learning technology to target ads at a level of accuracy not previously possible before the internet revolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://nest.com/about/">Nest</a> is (was?) a business focused on bringing traditionally "dumb" home products into modern times by making them "smart"<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Their core competency is an experienced team making great products (led by Tony Fadell the "godfather" of the iPod) and proven with the Nest Thermostat.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are some theories regarding why Google acquired Nest given Google's business does not require it to produce physical products end to end (in the same way e.g. Apple does).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Google's giant machine learning technology wants data from your home (via Nest) to get even better at predicting what you want and delivering that information to advertisers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stratechery.com/2014/googles-new-business-model/">Google is trying to become good</a> at being a products company to diversify it's current advertising business given its growth is highly correlated with the growth of internet usage which is predicted to peak in the next few years.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think there are many good points raised in the diversification argument, however, I see it as a side benefit. I find the acquisition to be quite in line with Google's current business model.</p>

<p>Just because internet usage is set to peak, doesn't mean Google will peak with it. Google will still have its core competency - a giant pool of human behaviour data and probably the best engineering team in existence to decipher that data and produce products and information based on that data. I think it's narrow minded to think this core competency won't be valuable beyond an advertising business.</p>

<p>I personally don't think Google is evil - selling your personal data to advertisers. I think that is currently a necessary compromise to achieve a greater goal. I think Google's aim is to build great products off the back of its core competency - it's just that this core competency takes a long time to develop and nobody on earth has the money and risk appetite to fund such a project.</p>

<p>Think of it as you will, Google is currently an ad supported giant R&amp;D project.</p>

<p>Advertising and sponsorship are currently the only ways to bring products to market without customers/users handing over cash. Most of the time, it's the best choice to keep bringing great products into the world.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean Google's business will always be advertising. If anything, this acquisition of Nest should be viewed positively that Google is maturing into a products company no longer reliant on ad money.</p>

<p>That would be an exciting thing.</p>
