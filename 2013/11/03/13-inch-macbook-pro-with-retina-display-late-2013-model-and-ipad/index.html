        <p>I am writing this on what is the best laptop 
<a href="/2013/06/20/Personal-statement-technology/">I've ever owned</a>.</p>

<p>The combination of battery life, quality and power is a huge step forward.</p>

<p>My previous laptop was a 2007 MacBook Pro - now carrying out home server duties.</p>

<p>I stopped using it around 2009/10 because the battery started swelling up and was never replaced due to cost vs benefit.</p>

<p>Instead of getting a new laptop, I held off as my iMac and iPhone were taking care of my computing needs fine. The iPad 2 was my first re-entry into the mobile computing world beyond a smartphone.</p>

<p>For a long time, I tried to adapt the work I needed to do on a mobile computer to the iPad platform. I went through the iPad 2 and then onto the iPad 3. I took them to Taiwan and Europe and used the camera connector kit to backup and view my photos from my SLR. I took them to class to take notes in lectures. I took them to work to take notes and keep organised.</p>

<p>What I learned was that the full size iPads (9.7 inch models), were not made for people like me. It doesn't hurt to have one - it never does - but if I could have only taken one of either a OS X device or an iOS device for my non smartphone needs, for me, it would have been a difficult choice.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>Computing on a MacBook is now insanely great.</p>

<p>The new line of Retina MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs released in 2013 with the Haswell 4th generation processors makes choosing between a MacBook vs an iPad a much fairer choice.</p>

<p>The iPads no longer have the trump cards of size/weight and battery life. Haswell has made that a much more even playing field. Add on the power saving improvements in OS X 10.9 Mavericks…and the battery life on these MacBooks is now truly "all day". 10 hours on the 13-inch Retina Pro and 13+ hours on the 13-inch Air.</p>

<p>To be fair, the iPads have caught up on their shortcomings too. The iPad Air and Retina Mini are now fairly beast-y when it comes down to computing power.</p>

<p>The comparison can now pretty much be solely made on the preferred operating system as the gap between everything else has been finally closed to a point where they are small trade-offs rather than deal breakers.</p>
