        <p>I am extremely happy to see the amount of attention given to the Mac on its 30th birthday.</p>

<p>Whilst we have many great computing devices now, the Mac is still my favourite.</p>

<p>I am even more happy about <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2090829/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html">Apple's vision for the Mac</a>.</p>

<p>So, happy birthday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShLWK9n2Sk">Mac</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Mac, today you are celebrating your 30th birthday. Here are some things we wanted you to know as you enter your fourth decade. Your early family really loved you. We had lots of fun being pirates and working very hard together, before you were born. You were a cute, chubby little baby who has grown up to be as slender as a No. 2 pencil with the power of an NFL middle linebacker. You were writing and drawing sketches at a very early age, who would have guessed that you'd now be making movies all by yourself and sharing it with people around the world.</p>

  <p>Your list of accomplishments is truly astounding. We are very, very proud of all the tasks you have mastered. Many more than we could have ever imagined! Never forget that your parents wanted you to always be respectful of the individuality of your users. And we hope that you will continue to help them communicate their uniqueness to each other.</p>

  <p>You can't let vanity and compliments about your beauty stop you from always remembering your core purpose: fostering innovation and creativity. Finally, don't forget to keep your sense of humor. True artist not only ship, but laugh! Don't forget about the little Mac Man who used to run across the desktop every once in a while. So, have an insanely great happy birthday. We all wish you continued success in your next 30 years, helping pilot the Mothership.</p>

  <p>Sincerely yours, members of the 1984 Macintosh Development Team.</p>
